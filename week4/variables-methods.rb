#How do you define a local variable?

# You set the variable name equal to a value.

#How do you define a method?

#You use the keyword def, then name the method, fill in parameters and the body, and end it.

#What is the difference between a local variable and a method?

#A local variable is a value assigned to variable name.  A method is a packet of code that you can execute over and over.

#How do you run a ruby program from the command line?

# ruby file_name.rb

#How do you run an RSpec file from the command line?

# rspec file_name_spec.rb

#What was confusing about this material? What made sense?

#I've had some exposure to Ruby so that part was easy, but I don't know much rspec and had to take my time working through that!
