      Git is a version control software that lives locally on your computer. Git allows you to save different versions of work as you go. On the other hand, Github lives remotely on the Internet so that programmers could share their code remotely and collaborate on projects at the same time.

      Version control software allows you to save different versions of you work and lets you create and work on different branches that allow you to switch back and forth out of interchangeably. Github lives on the Internet and could help programmers to collaborate remotely.

      Developers use version control to keep track of changes in their code. It becomes more and more important when you are working on the same files with collaborators. Instead of sending a file back and forth to work on it, developers can all work on the same files at the same time.

    <h2>Dana's Blog</h2>
 <p>Hey y'all, I'm Dana. I'm a 36-year-old female with no real background in tech, and I'm 100% terrified of git and GitHub.

I like writing. About things I like. I kind of laughed when I saw my first writing assignment for Dev Bootcamp was to explain the benefits of git and GitHub to a beginner. That's like me being asked to explain to myself, who does not know how to do a front handspring, how to do a front handspring, by just trying to execute a front handspring and then explaining it--all of which sounds VERY PAINFUL and INACCURATE.

And that is how I feel about version control.

#What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

We used sections, and the flowchart resource was really helpful in how we decided to ust section instead of paragraphs or articles.  I think I'll end up using paragraphs more often than sections, but having that resource to help me undersatnd when to use what, and why, is awesome.

#How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The browser seems to look for the structural elements in order of imporatnce to the layout (for example, it will place more structural importance on an <h1> tag than a <p> tag.)

#What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I loved learning about the snippets!  I'll definitely be using these in the future.  I have been using shortcut foo to learn some other sublime shortcuts, and have looked at a few resources.  I can't wait to feel really adept at using Sublime.
