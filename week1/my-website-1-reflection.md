#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Making a repository is easy!  Click the "+" icon next to your avatar on the top right page of your GitHub account.  Choose "New Repository".  You'll be promped to name your repository, choose public or private, choose the license you'd like, and then hit "Create Repository" at the bottom.  To clone that baby, go to the "HTTPS Clone URL" on the right side bar of your new repository and copy it.  On your command line, make sure you aren't currently in a GitHub repository, then type "git clone" and paste the URL.  Voila!

#Describe what open source means.

Open source means the code of a give program is freely available for anyone to see and make changes to.  Open Source projects foster collaboration and creativity.

#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open Source warms my cynical human heart and lets me believe that people do things for the joy of doing, vs. financial reward or obligation.  I love that all kinds of people are nerding out on creating software with each other, helping and encouraging each other.  Because I don't have any projects, it's hard for me to feel nervous or protective--I love the idea of Open Source and giving people access to what's happening "under the hood" so they may tinker as they like to improve their experience.

#Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses seem important if you have something you want to protect, be given credit for, or make money from.  Again, it's hard for me to feel personally attached to licenses since I don't have any projects of value, but naturally it makes sense to have different types of licenses to provide levels of protection for work done.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

It was less terrifying to make a new branch and create a pull request, but I did have an issue with an old branch, which had been deleted on GitHub, still showing up on git.  I got a warning that there were unmerged changes, even though I had merged everything.  I checked it out on Stack Overflow and ended up force deleting the branch on git, but I still always get nervous when I see any kind of warning because I don't quite understand git yet--even the explanations are confusing.

#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Not really.  The things I read about git just confused me more.  I'm excited to get to the bonus materials in this week to go through more with git and GitHub.

Using your new git and GitHub skills, commit and push your changes to your remote repository and go through the pull request process! Make sure you can see your reflection on GitHub.
