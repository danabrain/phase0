##What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The six phases of web design are:

1. Information Gethering (What is the purpose of the site, what goals should it accomplish, who is your target audience, and what kind of information will this site relay to them?)

2. Planning (Create a sitemap to organize your content.)

3. Design (Consider who will be using this site when you design it--what might they be feeling, wanting, searching for?  Design with the user in mind.)

4. Development (Write the code, and explore the first iteration of the site.)

5. Testing/Delivery (Revise the site as needed from both a design and a code standpoint.)

6. Maintenance (Keep that puppy looking good and up to date!)

##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal of this site (as of tonight) is to be a kind of online meet-and-greet, as well as a resume.  It will be a place to point future employers and fellow developers to what I've done and what I'm up to as I learn to code.

##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience's interests will primarily be tied to how I present myself with both content (copy) and design, functionality of the site, and the projects that I'll be able to upload in the future.  I'll want to make the site personable and fresh, and highlight my love for writing by weaving that into my posts about coding.

##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I want my user to want to know more about me--either by contacting me or checking out my writing.  I want the home page to be pleasant to look at, simple to navigate, and inviting in language, so that the user wants to click around.  Ideally, there will be some whimsy in the page too (once we get to JQuery!)

##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Some important things to think about are color scheme and how the colors work together, font type and readability, responsive design for various-sized devices, and structuring the page to optimize it for search results (as well as to present information in a way that makes sense to the user).

##What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience design is web design with the user in mind (that sounds redundant, but the name is explanatory).  When websites were designed prior to this discipline, they were designed according to what the designer thought was cool, or the favorite colors of the client, or something along these lines.  After some research about optimizing the user experience showed that small changes could be incredibly profitable or change user behavior in significant ways, designers started to think about how someone might interact with the website in addition to how cool it looked when they were designing a site.  And voila, UX was born!

##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

None really, I liked them all!  I like design--color wheels, layouts, etc.  I just wish I had more time this week to explore more of the additional resources mentioned in the recorded lecture.  But, I will when I can!
