- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

I've written several HTML pages over the last year so this wasn't my first rodeo.  I like HTML!  It's direct and simple.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Easy.  I was able to find information quickly (W3 schools had some great cheat sheets), and the HTML Checker tool was really useful to show me a couple errors.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

It's hard to NOT format!  But I kept myself in check--I'm excited for CSS next week!  I'm wondering if I'll need to reorganize my page for CSS styling, though...when I think about how to create 2 columns instead of one I sense some div wizardry ahead.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

Good:  clear, direct, simple to use.

Bad:  boring to look at--but it does the job.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?


Cheat sheets!  Also, most tags close, several tags have required attributes, and you have to declare the doctype!  But until I've written 100 HTML documents, I'm referring to other resources first.  Practice makes perfect!
